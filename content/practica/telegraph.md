There are several ways of going about this. We'll decide on one together.

- Following the lead of Rachel Sagner Buurma's [Critical Making: Telegraph + Twitter](http://rachelsagnerbuurma.org/uncategorized/critical-making-telegraph-twitter/) class, we could use the [tworsekey](https://code.google.com/archive/p/tworsekey/) "open design exercise in interface archaeology that decodes the input from a classic Morse telegraph to send twitter messages."
- The simple wood, copper, 9V battery [key and sounder method](https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Telegraph-Key-and-Sounder/).
- There's a section on making a telegraph in *The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Civilization in the Aftermath of a Cataclysm* (2015), a tongue-in-cheek guide to DIY infrastructures for surviving the apocalypse.
