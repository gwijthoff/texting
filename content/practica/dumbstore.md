Check out some of the following projects and resources.

### SMS apps and services

- the Dumbstore, for reluctant smartphone adopters. Now only available [on the wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20130523014355/http://www.dumbsto.re) and this [github repo](https://github.com/dumbstore/dumbstore)
- a list of other [SMS-based apps and services](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/no-apps-data-required-5-tools-inform-using-sms/)

### SMS art

- [Cellpoems](http://www.cellpoems.org/)
- Tamar Zohara Ettun, [How to Trap a Demon](https://pioneerworks.org/broadcast/how-to-trap-a-demon/). Uses the simpletexting.com app. [More on the project here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_8OvBwFCt4/?igshid=k5sydg4xhndb).
- [Send Me SFMOMA](https://www.sfmoma.org/read/send-me-sfmoma/), unfortunately no longer active!
    - “Text 572-51 with the words “send me” followed by a keyword, a color, or even an emoji and you’ll receive a related artwork image and caption via text message. For example “send me the ocean” might get you Pirkle Jones’ Breaking Wave, Golden Gate; “send me something blue” could result in Éponge (SE180) by Yves Klein; and “send me ?” might return Yasumasa Morimura’s An Inner Dialogue with Frida Kahlo (Collar of Thorns). Each text message triggers a query to the SFMOMA collection API, which then responds with an artwork matching your request.”
