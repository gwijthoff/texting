title: What does ðŸ’¬ actually mean?
when: September 9
---

An exploration of what the animated ellipsis indicates, on a number of messaging platforms.

<!--more-->

We'll discuss phatic expressions, non-propositional knowledge, and what was once known as the rhythm or "fist" of telegraph operators.

Pair up and fan out, choosing a different messaging platform for each pair. Say "hello" to your classmate, start typing, and discuss the feedback provided by the interface. Does your partner have to be actively typing for a ðŸ’¬ to appear on the other side? What happens if your partner enters text and stops typing, in order to think before sending? Does the ðŸ’¬ remain?

If it's easier, pairs can discuss what's happening via Zoom or phone call as they type.
