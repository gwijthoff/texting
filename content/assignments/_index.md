The goal of these assignments and grading rubrics are, above all, to remain accountable to one another and to set you up for success in the class. For me, this means setting clear and reasonable expectations. For you, this means staying connected as best you can and communicating about what's working and what isn't. Please note that *everything below can change if we need it to,* depending on world events, our collective energy while learning remotely, and the direction our conversations take us. For more detail on this, please read the [COVID caveat]({{< ref "/#admin" >}}).

## Comprehension

## Final Project [[details]({{< ref "/assignments/final" >}})]

A range of formats are possible for your final project, from essays to datasets, from visualizations to research reports for community organizations. Collaborative projects are an option. I will provide a list of possible project ideas, but would also love to hear your ideas. Worth 25 total points.

## Quizzes

In lieu of a midterm, you will be given two comprehension questions on odd-numbered weeks (Week 3, Week 5, etc). The questions will simply check your understanding of the course's main concepts. These 5 sets of questions will be worth 3 points each for a total of 15 points. Your lowest quiz grade can be dropped.

## Letter Writing [[details]({{< ref "/assignments/letters" >}})]

During even-numbered weeks (Week 2, Week 4, etc), you will write a letter and mail it to a classmate. Stamps and envelopes will be provided. We'll contextualize your correspondence during our weeks on the epistolary novel, the postal system, and the republic of letters. There's no need to share the letter with me or document it in any way. This component is done on the honor system. 5 total letters are worth 3 points each for a total of 15 points.

## Checking In

Checking in each week can include 1) participating in synchronous Zoom sessions during our regular class period, 2) participating in conversations on the class Slack, and 3) conducting our weekly [practica]({{< ref "/practica" >}}) on your own time and reporting on the results in the Slack `#practica` channel.

I understand that it won't be possible for everyone to participate in our synchronous Zoom meetings. Zoom attendance isn't required, but it will be the place where most course content is delivered. So I will share all slides and discussion notes after class. If you are participating on Zoom, please try to keep your camera on.

12 weeks in the semester are worth a maximum of 2 points each, with points given for either Zoom, Slack, or practica. An extra point is given at the end of the term if you check in every week, for a total of 25 points.

## Response Questions

Each week, I will share response questions on the readings in a dedicated `#response-questions` channel on the class Slack. These questions are meant to gauge what resonated with you in the week's materials, and to shape our synchronous Zoom conversation. Everyone should post their response directly in that channel. Ten weeks of response questions are worth 2 points each, for a total of 20.
