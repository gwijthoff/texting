title: Final Project
when: Due Dec 8

A range of formats are possible for your final project, from essays to datasets, from visualizations to research reports for community organizations. You can work individually, or in pairs or groups on your final projects. You should begin thinking about your final project around Fall Recess, and consult with me on your idea beginning Week 8 / Oct 21.

We'll keep a running list of project ideas below, organized by the different disciplinary tracks that run throughout the course: community technology, literary and cultural studies, or digital humanities. You can also use one of our [practica]({{< ref "/practica" >}}) as a starting point for your final project.

## Project Ideas

### community technology
- re-design community technology training materials for the Philadelphia Community Wireless Project
- research the state of community networks nationally to learn what has worked, what hasn't
- run your own social network using [this tutorial by Darius Kazemi](https://runyourown.social/), or [Komrade](https://github.com/quadrismegistus/Komrade), a "socialist network" designed by Ryan Heuser.

### literary / cultural studies

- compare the use of text messages in novels or films
- a distributed mind / quantified self project that picks up on the work done in our [SMS analysis]({{< ref "/practica/graphtexts" >}}) practicum

### digital humanities

- visualize or explore data in the Early Modern Letters Online database / republic of letters project
- perform a comparative analysis of the user experience design on various messaging platforms, picking up on our [what does ðŸ’¬ mean?]({{< ref "/practica/ellipsis" >}}) practicum.
- build a [portable network kit](https://communitytechny.org/portable-network-kits/) and use it to set up a local intranet for your neighbors. What content will you put on the network?
