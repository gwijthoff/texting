- answers to these `#response-questions`:
  - There are so many wonderful descriptions and examples of community in *Lurking.* What was one of your favorite and why?
  - In Chapter 3: Visibility, Joanne McNeil identifies a shift from the 1990s-2000s "dream of cyberspace [as] expanding interiority," to the 2010s "dream of visibility on social networks [as] something more like fame" (85). How do you understand this shift? What is the relationship between the rise of the "user" McNeil showcases throughout the book, and the drive toward fame?
