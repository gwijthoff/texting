- an answer to this `#response-question`:
  - Borsuk defines the book as "a portable data storage and distribution method" whose "changing form is bound up with that of its changing content." Write a little bit about how you understand the relationship between form and content when it comes to the messaging platforms you use today. If "content does not simply necessitate [writing's] form, but rather writing develops alongside, influences, and is influenced by the technological supports that facilitate its distribution," how has the form or technology of text messaging influenced some of the ways that you write to friends and family? How do you understand the "substrate" of your text messages, as Treharne and Willan explore them in Part II of *The History of Text Technologies*?
