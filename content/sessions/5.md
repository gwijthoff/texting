- [a letter to your classmate]({{< ref "/assignments/letters" >}})
- answers to these `#response-questions`:
  - What happened to municipal wireless in the 2000s in Philadelphia, and what is the status of municipal wireless elsewhere today?
  - If you could build a digital network from scratch, what would it look like? Think through the past few weeks' readings on community and infrastructure. Would the network be specific to a local region? Would it resemble a social network or some form of ISP? Would it primarily emphasize net neutrality, inclusion, services, or non-proprietary hardware?
