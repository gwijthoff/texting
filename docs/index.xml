      <title>The Idea</title>
      <link>https://gwijthoff.github.io/mutualaid/overview/idea/</link>

      <description>COVID-19 has transformed the landscape of academic research and funding. The coming months will require creativity and collaboration. This pilot project is an effort to think about how we might pool our resources and strengthen ties between local institutions. It is built on the model of mutual aid, in which &amp;ldquo;communities take on the responsibility for caring for one another, rather than forcing individuals to fend for themselves.&amp;rdquo;
The starting point will be digital humanities research consultations.</description>

      <title>What We Need</title>
      <link>https://gwijthoff.github.io/mutualaid/overview/need/</link>

      <description>We are currently seeking commitment from universities within the above NY / NJ / PA consortiums who a) have graduate student, postdoctoral, or contingent faculty DH researchers, and b) can commit to a pool of funding that will be dedicated to paying consultants an hourly rate. In other words, grad student / postdoc / contingent faculty consultants will be paid an hourly rate from their home institutions in exchange for conducting consultations with researchers at under-resourced institutions.</description>

      <title>What We Offer</title>
      <link>https://gwijthoff.github.io/mutualaid/overview/offer/</link>

      <description>We offer one-hour consultations on a variety of DH research or professional development questions, from mapping to text analysis, 3D modeling to design. Individuals can request no more than one session per month. We ask that requests for consultations come only from individuals at colleges or universities who do not currently have the digital humanities infrastructure in place to support their work.</description>

      <title>Who We Are</title>

      <description>The idea for this initiative began in conversations between the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton and the Rutgers University New Brunswick Digital Humanities Initiative. Both shops have committed to a pilot program in which they sync up their consultation programs and pay researchers an hourly rate for conducting outside consultations. We are currently seeking to scale up this initiative through partnerships with additional schools in three regional DH groups in the Mid-Atlantic region: NYCDH, NJDHC, and Keystone DH.</description>
