Survey participants will be asked to enter forms of aid and expertise that they can provide, that they need, or both. Eventually, forms of humanist expertise can be sampled from the data collected by the survey and featured here, e.g.
Scholars in the humanities can offer [idea], [idea], and [idea].Scholars in the humanities need [idea], [idea], and [idea]. In the future, community moderators might use survey suggestions to organize scheduled events for respondents, including: methods workshops, seminars, writing accountability groups, and consultations.
The following examples and categories of humanist mutual aid are only intended as suggestions. We welcome any and all ideas!
