session notes

Visitor: Devren Washington, Movement Alliance Project

This class session will be a collaboration with the Philly Community Wireless Project.

Before Class 📚 Read:  Breitbart, Joshua, Naveen Lakshmipathy, and Sascha D. Meinrath. “The Philadelphia Story: Learning from a Municipal Wireless Pioneer.” New America Foundation (2007) Introduction, Christina Dunbar-Hester, Low Power to the People: Pirates, Protest, and Politics in FM Radio Activism (MIT Press, 2014) Devren Washington, &amp;ldquo;Philly School District shouldn’t have to pay Comcast a dime to get kids online,&amp;rdquo; The Philadelphia Inquirer (Aug 26, 2020)  ✏️ Write:  a letter to your classmate answers to these #response-questions:  What happened to municipal wireless in the 2000s in Philadelphia, and what is the status of municipal wireless elsewhere today? If you could build a digital network from scratch, what would it look like? Think through the past few weeks&amp;rsquo; readings on community and infrastructure. Would the network be specific to a local region? Would it resemble a social network or some form of ISP? Would it primarily emphasize net neutrality, inclusion, services, or non-proprietary hardware?    ❀

Practicum None for this week.
