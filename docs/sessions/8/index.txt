Reminder: Election Day is in two weeks. Are you all set up to vote?

Also: it&amp;rsquo;s time to begin setting up meetings with me to discuss your final project.

Visitors: Lucas McMahon and Abigail Sargent on &amp;ldquo;Mapping Medieval Metadata,&amp;rdquo; a project that maps lead seals used to enclose correspondence and assure the recipient of the genuineness of the contents in the Byzantine Empire.

Before Class üìö Read:  Joanne McNeil, Lurking: How a Person Became a User (2020)  Introduction Chapter 3: Visibility Chapter 4: Sharing Closing: End User   Samples of a Byzantine letter and an administrative document, in advance of Lucas and Abigail&amp;rsquo;s visit.  ‚úèÔ∏è Write:  answers to these #response-questions:  There are so many wonderful descriptions and examples of community in Lurking. What was one of your favorite and why? In Chapter 3: Visibility, Joanne McNeil identifies a shift from the 1990s-2000s &amp;ldquo;dream of cyberspace [as] expanding interiority,&amp;rdquo; to the 2010s &amp;ldquo;dream of visibility on social networks [as] something more like fame&amp;rdquo; (85). How do you understand this shift? What is the relationship between the rise of the &amp;ldquo;user&amp;rdquo; McNeil showcases throughout the book, and the drive toward fame?    ‚ùÄ
