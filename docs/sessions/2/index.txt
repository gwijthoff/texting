Before Class 📚 Read:  Scott B. Weingart, &amp;ldquo;The Route of a Text Message, a Love Story&amp;rdquo;  🎧 Listen:  &amp;ldquo;Thank You, Text.&amp;rdquo; Reset podcast episode (26min)  📺 Watch:  A Brief Look at Texting and the Internet in Film (2014, 5min)  ✏️ Write:  answers to these #response-questions:  A single text message has to pass through many &amp;ldquo;layers&amp;rdquo; of translation and transmission. Explain how one of those layers works, as described by Weingart. What is one bug or feature of the new Rich Communication Standard (RCS), as it&amp;rsquo;s currently proposed?    ❀

Practicum What does the animated ellipsis (i.e. 💬) actually indicate on various messaging platforms?
