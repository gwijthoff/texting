An exploration of what the animated ellipsis indicates, on a number of messaging platforms.

We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss phatic expressions, non-propositional knowledge, and what was once known as the rhythm or &amp;ldquo;fist&amp;rdquo; of telegraph operators.

Pair up and fan out, choosing a different messaging platform for each pair. Say &amp;ldquo;hello&amp;rdquo; to your classmate, start typing, and discuss the feedback provided by the interface. Does your partner have to be actively typing for a ðŸ’¬ to appear on the other side? What happens if your partner enters text and stops typing, in order to think before sending? Does the ðŸ’¬ remain?

If it&amp;rsquo;s easier, pairs can discuss what&amp;rsquo;s happening via Zoom or phone call as they type.

Platforms to choose from:

 Facebook messenger Instagram Slack WhatsApp iMessage Signal Google Hangouts SMS GroupMe
