 Visit Early Modern Letters Online and browse the database to get a sense of the archival sources. Find one letter of interest that you&amp;rsquo;d like to tell the group about. What can you learn about the letter&amp;rsquo;s context from its metadata, and from browsing that person&amp;rsquo;s inbox?  In order to access library resources, you may have to log in to campus networks remotely via EZProxy or VPN. Also: Networking Archives is a &amp;ldquo;a three-year . . . research project which will merge the early modern correspondence data collected in Early Modern Letters Online with metadata from the Gale State Papers Online to create thereby the UK’s largest meta-archive of curated early modern correspondence metadata.&amp;rdquo;   Visit Stanford&amp;rsquo;s Mapping the Republic of Letters and browse some of the network visualizations of early modern correspondence.
