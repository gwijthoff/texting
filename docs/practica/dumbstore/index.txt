SMS apps and services  Not sure it belongs in this section but as a very reluctant smartphone adopter, I used to live by the The Dumbstore, for reluctant smartphone adopters. Now only available on the wayback machine.  and maybe this github repo   a list of other SMS-based apps and services  SMS art  Tamar Zohara Ettun, How to Trap a Demon. Uses the simpletexting.com app. More on the project here. Send Me SFMOMA, unfortunately no longer active!  “Text 572-51 with the words “send me” followed by a keyword, a color, or even an emoji and you’ll receive a related artwork image and caption via text message. For example “send me the ocean” might get you Pirkle Jones’ Breaking Wave, Golden Gate; “send me something blue” could result in Éponge (SE180) by Yves Klein; and “send me ?” might return Yasumasa Morimura’s An Inner Dialogue with Frida Kahlo (Collar of Thorns). Each text message triggers a query to the SFMOMA collection API, which then responds with an artwork matching your request.”   Cellpoems
