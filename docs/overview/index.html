	<p>It&rsquo;s an understatement to say that COVID-19 has transformed the landscape of academic research in the humanities. The coming months will require creativity and collaboration as we retrofit classes and workshops for screens, as we reel from the loss of funding and income. This pilot project is an effort to prepare by pooling resources and strengthening ties between local institutions. It is built on the model of mutual aid, &ldquo;in which people take responsibility for caring for one another and changing political conditions . . . by actually building new social relations that are more survivable.&rdquo; (<a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/social-text/article/38/1%20(142)/131/160175/Solidarity-Not-CharityMutual-Aid-for-Mobilization">Spade 2020</a>)</p>
<p>The goal of this project is ☞ to seed humanities research at under-resourced institutions at a moment when funding for the humanities is in jeopardy, and ☞ to build a platform showcasing the range of forums for humanities expertise in the broader world.</p>
<h2 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h2>
<p>The idea for this project grew from conversations between the Rutgers University–New Brunswick <a href="https://dh.rutgers.edu/">Digital Humanities Initiative</a> and the <a href="https://cdh.princeton.edu/">Center for Digital Humanities</a> at Princeton University.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-need">What We Need</h2>
<p>To begin, we are collecting requests for and offers of humanist expertise from graduate students, postdocs, and contingent faculty. Forms of aid might include translation, editing, data visualization, and archival methods consults. <a href="https://humanistmutualaid.com/types/">See this page</a> for more examples. The survey button below will collect your ideas.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-offer">What We Offer</h2>
<p>We are forming a community of moderators that consists of scholars at Rutgers and Princeton as well as volunteers from among survey participants. These moderators will match helpers with helpees, and meet regularly to shape the project as the community grows and communicates their needs.</p>
