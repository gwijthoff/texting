A range of formats are possible for your final project, from essays to datasets, from visualizations to research reports for community organizations. You can work individually, or in pairs or groups on your final projects. You should begin thinking about your final project around Fall Recess, and consult with me on your idea beginning Week 8 / Oct 21.

We&amp;rsquo;ll keep a running list of project ideas below, organized by the different disciplinary tracks that run throughout the course: community technology, literary and cultural studies, or digital humanities. You can also use one of our practica as a starting point for your final project.
