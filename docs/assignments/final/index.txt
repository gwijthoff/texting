There are several different &amp;ldquo;tracks&amp;rdquo; that run throughout this course: community technology, literary and cultural studies, or digital humanities. Focusing on one track will allow students to rehearse their final project ideas through readings or practica in each of those tracks throughout the term.

Students can work in pairs or groups on their final projects.

We&amp;rsquo;ll keep a running list of project ideas below. You can also use one of our practica as a starting point for your final project.
