There are several different &amp;ldquo;tracks&amp;rdquo; that run throughout this course: community technology, literary and cultural studies, or digital humanities. Focusing on one track will allow students to rehearse their final project ideas through readings or practica in each of those tracks throughout the term.
Students can work in pairs or groups on their final projects.
We&amp;rsquo;ll keep a running list of project ideas below. You can also use one of our practica as a starting point for your final project.</description>

I will pair you with a classmate who you can write biweekly letters to during the semester. Stamps, envelopes, and maybe some carbon tracing paper so you have an analog outbox will all be provided.
You can think about and experiment with the way you write during our weeks on the epistolary novel, the postal system, and the republic of letters.</description>
