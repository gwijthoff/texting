      <description>A range of formats are possible for your final project, from essays to datasets, from visualizations to research reports for community organizations. You can work individually, or in pairs or groups on your final projects. You should begin thinking about your final project around Fall Recess, and consult with me on your idea beginning Week 8 / Oct 21.
We&amp;rsquo;ll keep a running list of project ideas below, organized by the different disciplinary tracks that run throughout the course: community technology, literary and cultural studies, or digital humanities.</description>

      <description>I will pair you with a classmate who you can mail a letter to every other week in the semester. Stamps, envelopes, and maybe some carbon tracing paper so you have an analog outbox will all be provided.
You can think about and experiment with the way you write during our weeks on the epistolary novel, the postal system, and the republic of letters.</description>
