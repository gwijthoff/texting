## AMS 343 / ENG 238&lt;br&gt;Fall 2020

### Wed, 1:30–3:20 &#43;Practicum

### Professor Grant Wythoff&lt;br&gt;gwythoff@princeton.edu&lt;br&gt;Office Hours: Tue: 3:00-5:00

# {{&lt; sms &gt;}} Description {#description}

This seminar will explore how we negotiate the distance between ourselves and others through text messages. Texts sustain an ambient intimacy that is increasingly redefining borders that range from the interpersonal—via anonymous mental health support—to the international—via reporting platforms for immigrant communities. What technical and social expectations of privacy do we operate with when sending a point-to-point message? How do novelists incorporate text messages into works of fiction? What does it mean that Frank Ocean [can sing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnnwfgqdEGM), “you text nothing like you look”?

Students will apply methods from literary theory and textual criticism to text messages. They will learn about the technical standards of SMS, now twenty years old. Readings on virality, surveillance, leaks, and migration and mobile media will be paired with lab experiments in telegraphy, encrypted messaging, and community mesh networks.

## Objectives {#objectives}

This course is devoted to developing critical data literacies. This means that students will:

1) review the numerical and categorical information that is collected about them when using social media and messaging platforms,
2) learn how, where, and by whom their texts are encoded, transmitted, and stored, and
3) experiment with alternative messaging platforms that will require them to learn some basic computational tools.

Experiments will be prepared during 2hr class discussions and conducted during 1hr practicum sessions, to take place at a time of each student&#39;s choosing. No prior experience with code or critical theory is required.

Joanne McNeil, *Lurking: How a Person Became a User* (2020)
